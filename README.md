This project is called the Runoff Report. Using leaflet.js, I was able to create an application that allows a user to select a certain area and determine the annual stormwater runoff. It would take it a step further and implement calculus to determine the gradient of the surroundings and predict the likely location of the runoff. This tool can be used by green infrastructure planners to determine the best location for rain gardens.
